Sieve.NET
=========

An expression-based filter library for .NET. We aim for a fluent interface to build expressions to filter complex business objects.

I am new to both expressions and open source, so this will be as much an experiment as it is an open-source repo.

There's nothing here yet.

Roadmap / Goals
===
* Ability to create Sieves for a given object
* Ability to craft Sieves that can be located (and easily locate them)
* Ability to quickly process a list of Sieves against an object.
